Stuff that'll eventually become a set of
[LanguageTool](http://www.languagetool.org/) rules for catching the grammatical
mistakes fanfiction authors most commonly seem to make.

Currently, the files are as follows:

 * **grammar.xml:** A small set of hand-written rules.
 * **new.xml:** A large set of machine-translations from my TSV-styled shorthand
   which need to be tuned and added to grammar.xml.
 * **NOTES:** Human-readable TODO notes.

Probably not useful to anyone, but better to have them backed up on GitHub and
available to any interested parties than not.

This content is intended to be released under the same license as LanguageTool
itself. This is believed to be the GNU Lesser GPL version 3.0 but, due to the
ambiguous nature of the LicenseTool website, the version cannot be confirmed.

As such, it is licensed under version 2.1 to err on the side of permissive
caution while still allowing the license to be upgraded to 3.0 as needed.
