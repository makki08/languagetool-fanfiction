Stuff that'll eventually become a set of [LanguageTool](http://www.languagetool.org/) rules for catching the grammatical mistakes fanfiction authors most commonly seem to make.

Currently, the files are as follows:

 * **grammar.xml:** A small set of hand-written rules.
 * **new.xml:** A large set of machine-translations from my TSV-styled shorthand  which need to be tuned and added to grammar.xml.
 * **NOTES:** Human-readable TODO notes.

Probably not useful to anyone, but better to have them backed up on GitHub and available to any interested parties than not.
