Corrections to add:
- loamed over -> loomed over
- that when according -> that went according | that when, according
- quite and -> quiet and
- bijou -> biiju (sp.?)
- Karusa -> Karasu (Naruto)
- wondered the -> wandered the
- no auguring -> no arguing ("Auguring" is a method of drilling a hole in the ground. Typically, for fence-posts. You probably mis-typed "arguing" instead.)
- r"tusk,? tusk" -> tsk, tsk (Unless your character is doing a humorous reaction to being face-to-face with an angry elephant or warthog, this is a typo)
- felt feint -> felt faint
- Lego -> Leggo | LEGO
- the raucous that -> the ruckus that
- breathing was rugged -> breathing was ragged

Stuff to consider:
- A chapter without any <hr> tags is either too short or using jury-rigged alternatives.
- Is it feasible to check for mixed tenses?
- Decide how to provide a set of supplemental dictionaries for spell checkers so I don't have to anticipate every typo.
- Look for a way to check for an even number of double-quote characters and possibly some instances of single quote characters. (ensure closed quotes)
- Figure out how to test for run-on sentences, oversized paragraphs, and undersized chapters. (will require some statistical analysis)
