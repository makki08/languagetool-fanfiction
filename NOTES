Stuff to consider:
- A chapter without any <hr> tags is either too short or using jury-rigged alternatives.
- Is it feasible to check for mixed tenses?
- Decide how to provide a set of supplemental dictionaries for spell checkers so I don't have to anticipate every typo.
- Look for a way to check for an even number of double-quote characters and possibly some instances of single quote characters. (ensure closed quotes)
- Figure out how to test for run-on sentences, oversized paragraphs, and undersized chapters. (will require some statistical analysis)
