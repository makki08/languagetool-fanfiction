- A chapter without a single <hr> tag is either too short or using jury-rigged alternatives.
- How about a check for mixed tenses?
- Perhaps a set of supplemental dictionaries for aspell/ispell/etc. which contain tons of anime-related names and terms, complete with proper capitalization?
- Try to confirm an even number of double-quote characters and possibly some instances of single quote characters. (ensure closed quotes)
- Look into some way of detecting at least some mis-uses of "it's".
- Test for run-on sentences, oversized paragraphs, and undersized chapters. (will require some statistical analysis)
- Remember to have a distinction between "personal" and "impersonal" proper nouns. (personal ones can't be prefixed by "the")

Stuff to improve:
- Checking for dubbed named when they are a poor choice.
- more checks for equivalents to "down load". (Stuff that shouldn't contain spaces and/or hyphens but does)
- Use one of the more advanced variants of Backus-Naur Form. That is, ABNF, EBNF, or a combination.
- Words should be classified by past/present/future (verbs), subject/object (pronouns), posessiveness (pronouns), and so on.
- In order to support multiple languages, all word classes should be generated from the Backus-Naur ruleset.
- Start planning a better grammar checker based on:
	1. defining what are verbs, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, and adverbs
	2. defining valid sentence structures
	3. whitelisting certain sentence fragment structure+position combinations
	4. testing with known-good documents and then refining the rules
- The BNF-derivative ruleset should support regex-like capture groups in order to allow MS Word-like suggestion of alternatives.
